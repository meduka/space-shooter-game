# Welcome to Galactic Catastrophe!

The first section of your should give a brief description of your game. (Perhaps ## About would be a good heading). You'll get 6/10 for a very basic description and an 8/10 or 10/10 if you include details, perhaps a backstory, etc. 

## Controls:


Start the game and shoot using space


Move using the left and right arrow keys


Pause/Unpause using the P key

## Instructions

Kill all the enemies coming towards you while dodging their blasters

6) Create another section of your game which gives detailed instructions about how to play. Instructions should include how to run the game, all controls, and scoring. Also discuss stages and game ending as appropriate. For describing basic controls only, you'll get an 6/10. You can get either a 8/10 or 10/10 if your instructions also clearly describe all features such as number of hits to kill different enemies, scoring, how difficulty increases, what power-ups do, etc. Use multiple paragraphs if it helps with organization and clarity.
