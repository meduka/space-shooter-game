# Welcome to Galactic Catastrophe!

Space travel is a dangerous endeavor, my friend. In the thick of a sector infamous for space pirates, your cargo ship is attacked by the most powerful of pirate group of them all, the Outsiders! They seek to steal your store of genetically modified Attack Cats for their own use, and you must protect both yourself and your rare freight. Can you succeed?

## Controls:

Move using the left and right arrow keys


Pause/Unpause using the P key

## Instructions

Kill all the enemies coming towards you while dodging their blasters

6) Create another section of your game which gives detailed instructions about how to play. Instructions should include how to run the game, all controls, and scoring. Also discuss stages and game ending as appropriate. For describing basic controls only, you'll get an 6/10. You can get either a 8/10 or 10/10 if your instructions also clearly describe all features such as number of hits to kill different enemies, scoring, how difficulty increases, what power-ups do, etc. Use multiple paragraphs if it helps with organization and clarity.
