# Welcome to Galactic Catastrophe!

Space travel is a dangerous endeavor, my friend. In the thick of a sector infamous for space pirates, your cargo ship is attacked by the most powerful of pirate group of them all, the Outsiders! They seek to steal your store of genetically modified Attack Cats for their own use, and you must protect both yourself and your rare freight. Can you succeed?

## Instructions


Start the game using the space key. Once the game has started, the space key becomes your shoot button.


Move using the left and right arrow keys.


Pause/Unpause using the P key.


Press X to close out your game session.


Equipped with your weaponized cats, kill all the enemies coming towards. You have 5 health units in total that go down when you are hit, so you must dodge their blasters to stay alive. If you come in contact with an enemy ship directly, you will die immediately.

6) Create another section of your game which gives detailed instructions about how to play. Instructions should include how to run the game, all controls, and scoring. Also discuss stages and game ending as appropriate. For describing basic controls only, you'll get an 6/10. You can get either a 8/10 or 10/10 if your instructions also clearly describe all features such as number of hits to kill different enemies, scoring, how difficulty increases, what power-ups do, etc. Use multiple paragraphs if it helps with organization and clarity.
